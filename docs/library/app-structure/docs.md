Documentation and documents in general.

## Documents Folder

The `ðŸ“‚ docs` folder is where we organize the application's general documents.

It serves to organize useful files such as documentation, design, architecture, integrations, etc.

Anything that is useful to other people also working on the application's development, or that
is useful in development, maintenance, or evolution.

You should keep in mind that overly large binary files can pollute and permanently clutter the
code repository, i.e., GIT. Because any overly large file sent to GIT considerably increases
the change history, video files, zip files, or any other very large documents
should be avoided to avoid overloading GIT and creating future constraints.
