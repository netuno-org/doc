Database File Organization.

## Database Folder

The `ðŸ“‚ dbs` folder is intended to store your application's database files.

In the case of H2 Database databases, all files are automatically generated in this folder.

This folder is useful for storing anything related to the database, such as backups, scripts,
dumps, diagrams, etc.

All database-related documentation that should accompany the application project is recommended
to be organized in this folder.
