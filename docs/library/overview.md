Netuno is a low-code platform for fast web services creation that facilitates data management with an integrated visual interface, ensuring the creation of web-based applications with high performance.

It reduces development effort and time, as well as production costs in administration, management and industrial areas.

Learn how Netuno further improves your programming experience so you may have a creative and non-repetitive experience while keeping the same performance levels since the development to the execution:

### Forms and fields

The data model creation is eased by the web environment based forms engine. The form setup generates database tables and it's fields define database columns. It's possible to parametrize the data type, field properties as well as it's relations. The WEB construction suite offers multiple features such as database queries, Entity-Relationship Model visualization and many more features.

### Access and permissions management

User and permissions management are also configurable in the WEB environment and are assessable through backend services in Netuno. It's also possible to restrict user and group access to forms and reports.

### Resource Library

The resource library features a wide range of ready-to-use features. Among these you can find from integrators with PDF, Excel, Email, Firebase to task scheduling or report generator with Jasper.

### API Rest

The server's communication layer is provided by REST API. The provision of services by JSON allows Netuno to communicate with multiple applications of different nature, for example, it can serve simultaneously WEB clients and mobile applications on the same interface.

### Polyglot service layer

Write services in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript" target="_blank">JavaScript</a>, <a href="http://groovy-lang.org/" target="_blank">Groovy</a>, <a href="https://www.jython.org/" target="_blank">Python</a>, <a href="https://www.jruby.org/" target="_blank">Ruby</a>, <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/" target="_blank">Kotlin</a> or in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)" target="_blank">Java</a>, they're all valid. Netuno removes the isolation between programming languages, the same application supports services running simultaneously in multiple languages without increasing the processing weight.

### Multiple database support

Configure several different databases and use them simultaneously. Natively Netuno supports several relational database engines like <a href="https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html" target="_blank">H2DataBase</a>, <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/" target="_blank">PostgreSQL</a>, <a href="https://mariadb.org/" target="_blank">MariaDB (_MySQL_)</a>, Microsoft SQL Server and Oracle. You will be able to create your application using, for example, PostgreSQL with a master database and integrate with other databases in MariaDB, and in the middle of a project you can switch to Microsoft SQL Server or Oracle without having to make any code changes. 

### Serverless

Netuno is also your application server. With a command run your application without having to waste time on licensing, configuration and additional developments. 

### Performance in development and execution

You don't need to learn how to work with a new development software by drag and drop, nor to memorize the interface of a new framework. With the possibility of programming in 6 different languages, having a self-generated data layer and with libraries available to use on-the-fly, Netuno's low-code is the best solution for your tight deadlines.

Using code generators optimized for high performance and using the recent <a href="https://www.graalvm.org/" target="_blank">GraalVM</a>, the speed of the application server is also incredible, no matter what language it uses.
