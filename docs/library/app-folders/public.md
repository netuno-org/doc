## Public/

The `public` folder gathers the UI (User Interface) client-side content after compilation. It is sub-organized in the folders: `images`, `scripts` and `styles`.

  #### Public folder structure

  By default, you will find the following structure when you enter the 'public' folder:

  ```plaintext
├─ images/
│  ├─ logo.png
│  └─ logo-main.png
├─ scripts/
│  ├─ app/
│  ├─ main.js
└─ styles/
   └─ main.css

  ```

  ### Images/

  The `images` folder initially contains two images about Netuno.  This folder is where you can place all the images of your application.

  ### scripts/

  In `scripts` is the data output of the javascript code generated by the webpack, that is:
  
  The `main.js` file which groups all the javascript files of the application and the corresponding `main.js.map`.

  ### styles/
  
  In the `styles` folder you can add CSS elements that will be loaded by the application. Typically used for global CSS or for rewriting Neptune styles.
