> The Netuno platform is free, [start now](../installation/).

With the automatic data management interface that supports user and group profiles, it is possible to use Netuno as a backoffice but also as an application interface for the end user, because it quickly allows you to create an experimental prototype of the project and start testing and filing your data structure to provide a strong foundation for the programming that will be carried out.

With the low-code REST API construction and OpenAPI 3.0 support it allows easy integration with other systems, mobile applications, portals and online stores.

With the generation of applications with the frontend already integrated with ReactJS and Ant.Design it is possible to develop modern, intuitive and responsive interfaces for the end user.

It integrates the NPM + WebPack execution with the server and thus, in a single output, allows to understand what happens and quickly visualize the problems both at backend and frontend areas.

The Netuno framework is vast allowing the rapid development of the main requirements most used in development and supports integration with any external library in Java, Kotlin, command line, APIs, among others.

It supports configurations by environments of development, testing and production, automatically generates the construction of the database via code and allows it to be customized, allows the extension of the forms generated automatically through components and actions to measure, generates the visualization in diagram of the database, allows the execution of queries in the database via browser, among many other features.

The Netuno server is prepared to provide applications associated with web domains and customize the endpoints (addresses).

Conquer new challenges through the advantages that Netuno offers, gain time and save money in project development.
