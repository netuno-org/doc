## Requirements

##### Java

Make sure you have Java installed by running the below command into the terminal:

`java -version`

Java version should be version 11.

Or install Java <a href="https://adoptopenjdk.net/" target="_blank">AdoptOpenJDK</a>.

##### NPM

It is not mandatory but NPM should be installed in order to compile the user interface _(frontend)_ of applications:

`npm -version`

The NPM version should be version 6 or higher.

Or install the <a href="https://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">NodeJS</a> that the NPM will also be installed.

## Considerations

Running the installation command below will change the path in the terminal from where you were to the new **Netuno** folder that will be created.

If is needed to run the installation command line again you will need to correct the path and probably remove the **Netuno** folder that was created.

## Linux or Mac OS X

Choose one of the following **Installation** options:

* Download with *WGET*:

```plaintext

mkdir -p netuno && cd netuno && wget https://github.com/netuno-org/platform/releases/download/latest/netuno.jar -O netuno.jar && java -jar netuno.jar install

```

* Download with *cURL*:

```plaintext

mkdir -p netuno && cd netuno && curl https://github.com/netuno-org/platform/releases/download/latest/netuno.jar > netuno.jar && java -jar netuno.jar install

```

## Windows

In Windows open the terminal of **PowerShell** go to the start menu and type: `powershell`

Now copy and paste the command below and follow the **Installation** steps:

```plaintext

md netuno; cd netuno; Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://github.com/netuno-org/platform/releases/download/latest/netuno.jar" -OutFile "netuno.jar"; java -jar netuno.jar install

```
