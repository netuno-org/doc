Before you start learning Neptune, you need to be sure you have:

- A willingness to step outside your comfort zone.
- Interest and patience to learn new things.
- A desire to do more in less time.

And of course, most importantly:

- No need to spend any money to learn and use technologies.

Neptune is open source and, of course, completely free, as are all the technologies we promote and teach.

Focusing on boosting your programming career to achieve independence, through knowledge in fullstack you will
gradually gain total autonomy.

Each time you learn more about fullstack, you will be more capable of working with other people in other areas.

Understanding fullstack will help you better decide if your natural aptitude is more for frontend or backend.

How can you interact with someone in backend without knowing anything about it? And suggest something to someone
in frontend without understanding?

> The Netuno platform promotes fullstack by demystifying backend.

Many people would like to program, but unfortunately not everyone succeeds because there are many barriers in
the process.

With Netuno, the learning curve will be easier because there are fewer barriers, but there are still no miracles.

This is because developing web solutions, like any type of IT solution, requires a high level of concentration
and persistence; giving up is out of the question!

During the learning process, this ends up being developed indirectly, but many give up along the way with the
excuse that it is too difficult. If it were too easy, it would be easily automated, and thus human intelligence
would not be needed to perform the development.

Netuno simplifies many layers in the development of web solutions, applications, back office, and REST APIs, but
the human factor with its creativity and intelligence is needed to make everything happen.

> The Netuno platform is free and open source, [get started now](/docs/get-started/installation).

So proceed with confidence knowing you can do it, and when you're lost, why not ask for help?
