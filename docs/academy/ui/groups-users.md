## Creating/Editing users

In this tutorial we will explain how to create users and groups in the Netuno application.

To do so, after logging in to the Netuno platform, go to the top right menu and click on '_Developer_', as shown in the following image:

After clicking the menu, you have 4 options. To create or edit a user click on the 'User' menu:

You will later come across the following screen with several fields described below:

In which, each field corresponds to the following:

1. If you want to edit a user, choose from the drop-down menu
2. The user name (_display name_)
3. The username (_username_) **(must be in lowercase and may only contain periods)**
4. The password
5. The group associated with the user
6. Indicates if the user is active on the Netuno platform, that is, if he can use the platform
