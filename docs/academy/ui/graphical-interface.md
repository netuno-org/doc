## Netuno Admin

The Netuno interface is divided into two workspaces, each with specific and distinct purposes. *View* mode is for interacting with and displaying the final application result (Frontend), and *Build* mode is for developing your application.

### View

This is the frontend environment where users interact with the visual part of the application.

#### 1 - Build

This button allows you to access the application development mode.

#### 2 - Dropdown

Allows you to select options to manage your session, such as logging out, changing your account password, and viewing your user and group data.

#### 3 - My desktop

This is a central area, where your web application frontend, programmed in the `public` folder is displayed.

### 4 - Form tables

 In this area, you'll find access to all data tables. Click to view, add, edit, or delete data directly through forms.


### Build

It is the low-code environment where you configure and manage all aspects of your application without the need to write extensive code.

#### 4 - Management

This section allows you to manage forms, reports, queries and diagrams.

### 5 - Debug

This section allows you to monitor and inspect script behavior at runtime. This allows you to identify problems, track variable values, and understand the code execution flow.

#### 6 - Field Management

This section allows you to manage the structure of your data tables. You can add, edit, or remove fields and define the data type (text, number, date, etc.) for each one.
