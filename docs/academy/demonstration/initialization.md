## Demo Application initialization

First we have to start the Demo app to begin this tutorial.

Inside the folder where the platform is installed:

- `ðŸ“‚ /netuno`

In the terminal, run the command to start the Demo application:

```shell
./netuno server
```

If this command doesn't work try:

```shell
./netuno server app=demo
```

## Code Editor

Use your code editor of choice.

To develop the application's general code, whether backend or frontend, we recommend free code editors, such as:

- VS Codium: <a href="https://vscodium.com/" target="_blank">vscodium.com</a>
- Atom: <a href="https://atom.io/" target="_blank">atom.io</a>
- VS Code: <a href="https://vscodium.com/" target="_blank">code.visualstudio.com</a>
- WebStorm: <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/" target="_blank">jetbrains.com/webstorm</a>

Open the application folder in your editor:

- `ðŸ“‚ apps/demo`

Inside this folder contains all the files for the new application and is where all the development takes place.
