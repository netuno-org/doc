## Building a Form

To start to build a form just click on the top right hand side button, where it says **"Build"**.

As you can see here is the development area, where data can be managed, structure, analyzed also you will be able to do some queries and view the data model diagram.

On your left-hand sidebar just click on **"Management"** then will display some options that you will choose **"Forms"**.

In this step please type **"Task"** on the **"Display Name"**. Please note that the name in the field was automatically filled in lowercase letters, which means that this name will be given to the database table that will be created along with your form, and the _Display Name_ is the one that will appear to the end-user in the **"View"** area.

Every form will be always associated with the database table where the data will be stored.

After filling in all these `Names` just click **"Save"** below.

Have a look on your left sidebar and will show a new menu option with all `Names` built, in this case **"Task"**.
Click on **Task** now to enter the field for this form.

## Building a Field

In this step just type `Name` in the **Display Name** to create the new field that will store your `Task` _Name_.

Which will be the field to store the name of the departments.

And notice again that the field **Name** was automatically filled with lowercase letters, this will be the name of the database column created and storing the data in this field.

While you activate the option **"Primary Key"** will prevent that departments could have repeated names.

Your should also click on option **Not Null** which will require you to complete this field when creating and editing departments.

Below you have the option **"Type"** just choose **_text_** this means that our field is _text_ type.

>Note that you have a new option on the side bar menu: **Task**.
