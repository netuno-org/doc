## Create Form

To create a form, click in the top right-hand corner on the button that says **Build**.

This is the developer's area, where you can develop the entire data structure, run database queries, analyse the data model diagram and much more.

The construction of the forms can be found in the menu that says **Management** and then in the option **Forms**.

Type `Task' in the **Display Name** of the form, note that the **Name** field has been automatically filled in with lower case letters, the _Name_ field is the name that will be given to the database table, which will be created together with the creation of the form, and the _Display Name_ is what will appear to the end user in the **View** area.

Each form always has an associated database table where the information is stored.

With the _Form Names_ filled in, click on **Save**.

Now on the left-hand side you have a new menu option with the name of the form created: **Task**.

After clicking on **Task** in the menu, you enter the field management of the _Task_ form.

## Create Field

Fill in `Name` in the **Display Name** to create the new field that will store the name of the tasks.

This will be the field to store the name of the departments.

And note again that the **Name** field has been automatically filled in with lower case letters, this will be the name of the column created in the database to store the data for this field.

Activate the **Primary Key** option, which will prevent departments from having a repeated name.

Also activate the **Not Null** option, which will make filling in this field compulsory when creating or editing departments.

Under type, choose **text** which will indicate that our field is of type _text_.

Finally, click on the **Save** option to save the whole process.

## View

After successfully completing the previous steps, let's visualise the final result.

To do this, click on the **Visualise** button in the top right-hand corner.

Notice that you now have a new option in the side menu: **Task**.

By clicking on the **Task** menu you will be able to create, edit, search for and delete tasks. In other words, you'll be able to manipulate the data.

This is the result of the end user being able to manipulate the system's data.

## Upload Data

Now you can insert the records of the **Tasks**.

Click on the `[ + New content ]` button in the top right-hand corner, fill in the **Name** field and click on the `[ Save ]` button.

You can insert example tasks, such as:

- Support
- Commercial
- Meeting
- Invoicing
- Billing
