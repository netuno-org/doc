## Creating fields

This tutorial will help you create fields for your forms and explain each type of these fields.

Once you have created the form, the next step is to create fields for it.

## 1 - Display Name

As with the forms, the first step in creating a field is to assign a **Display Name**. This name should allow an easy identification of what the field is, since it is the name shown to the user.

## 2 - Field's Name
This name will be automatically filled in with a name like the one assigned to **Display Name**, for easy identification in the database. This name will only be seen by the user through the database. It cannot contain special characters or capital letters.

## 3 - Field's Type
The last step in creating a field is choosing the type of field. In this tutorial some of the available fields will be covered.

* checkbox
* color
* date
* text

### checkbox
The checkbox type allows you to select a value that is 0 or 1 (true or false).

Using the form **Car** as an example, we could create a **checkbox** type field called **New**, which would determine whether the car is new or not.

### color
The **color** type allows you to select a color through a javascript pop-up.
