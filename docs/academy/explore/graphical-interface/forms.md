## How to create forms

This tutorial will help you create forms on the Netuno platform.

It is divided into two essential and mandatory steps, and a small approach to the **grouping of forms** and the **mode diagram**.

## 1 - Assigning a Display Name

The first thing to do when creating a form is to define a display name.

The display name is the name seen by the user. It is the title of the form, which will appear in the tab **Manage Fields**

as in the tab **Forms**, on the display screen.

## 2 - Field Name

When you assign a name to the **Display Name**, the **Field Name** is automatically filled with that same name so that it can be easily identified in the database.

However, this name can be changed if we want.

This is the name that will identify the form in the database.

## 3 - Form grouping (Father)

It is possible to create a form in order to group other forms in the same context.

For example, a form **Vehicles** could be created and be the parent form of the forms **Car, Motorcycle**, etc, thus creating an organization by groups, helping in the overview.

## Diagram Mode

The diagram mode allows the user to have an overview of the forms created as well as their fields and relationships.

> Try creating multiple forms and multiple fields and view in diagram mode!

## Next Step

Save the form and move on to the next step: creating fields!

See [here](fields.md) how to start creating fields.
