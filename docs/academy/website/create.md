## ReactJS Application

In the root of your Netuno application, run:

`npm create vite`

When asked: `Ok to proceed? (y)`

Type `y` and press the [ENTER] key.

Next, with the question: `? Project name: â€º`

Type `website` and press the [ENTER] key.

Next, comes the question: `? Select a framework:`

Use the arrow keys on your keyboard, and press the down key until you select the `React` option and press the [ENTER] key.

To finish, the following question: `? Select a variant:`

Use the arrow keys on your keyboard, and press the down key until you select the `JavaScript` option and press the [ENTER] key.

This command will create a new directory called `ðŸ“‚ website` where the ReactJS application will be contained.

After creating the ReactJS application, run the following command to install the dependencies:

```
cd website
npm install
```

With this, you can start the React application with the command:

`npm run dev`

This will start the application at [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/), or at another address with a different port number. Either way, simply open this address in your browser to view the developments.

> To end the ReactJS application at any time, in the terminal, simply press `CTRL+C` simultaneously.

## Installing Dependencies

We strongly recommend that you install the following NPM packages, as they are very useful for developing ReactJS applications with Netuno (click on each link to get more information about each one):

* [react-router-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom)
* [antd](https://www.npmjs.com/package/antd)
* [@ant-design/icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ant-design/icons)
* [less](https://www.npmjs.com/package/less)
* [@netuno/service-client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@netuno/service-client)

To install the packages listed above, simply run the following set of commands in the terminal:

```
npm install --save react-router-dom
npm install --save antd
npm install --save @ant-design/icons
npm install --save less
npm install --save @netuno/service-client
```

Alternatively, you can also install all packages at once:

```
npm i -S react-router-dom antd @ant-design/icons less @netuno/service-client
```

## Configurations

After running the commands above, you can force a default port address, go to `ðŸ“‚ website/vite.config.js` and add the `server` configuration as follows:

```javascript title="website/vite.config.js"
export default defineConfig({
    server: {
        port: 3000,
        strictPort: true
    },
    plugins: [
        react()
    ]
})
```

Now when starting with the command `npm run dev` it will always use the port `3000`.

### Less

Change all `.css` files that are in `website/src` to the `.less` extension.

> Don't forget to make this change in the JSX code in the lines that `import` the `.css` files, change to `.less`.

LESS allows for a more structured and modern CSS development.

### Customizing the Ant.Design Theme

To customize the colors of Ant.Design use the `ConfigProvider` component in `App.jsx`.

For example:

```jsx
import { ConfigProvider, Button } from 'antd';
...
function App() {
    ...
    return (
        <ConfigProvider theme={{ token: { colorPrimary: '#00b96b' } }}>
        ...
            <Button type="primary">My Button with Custom Color</Button>
        ...
        </ConfigProvider>
    );
}
...
```

This way you can adjust any Ant.Design styling configuration.

### Dark Theme

It is also possible to use the dark theme of Ant.Design, to do this simply import the `theme` that contains the dark mode and apply it to the `ConfigProvider`:

```jsx
import { ConfigProvider, Button, theme } from 'antd';
...
    <ConfigProvider theme={{
        token: {
            colorPrimary: '#FF6500'
        },
        algorithm: theme.darkAlgorithm,
    }}>
        ...
        <Button type="primary">My Button with Custom Color</Button>
        ...
    </ConfigProvider>
...
```

### Restyle

Note that in the `ConfigProvider` parameterizations above, it is possible to easily change the Ant.Design style, more about Ant.Design customization:

- [Customize Theme](https://ant.design/docs/react/customize-theme)

In each Ant.Design component there are possible Design Token configurations, for example in Buttons:

- [Button - Design Token](https://ant.design/components/button#design-token)

```jsx
<ConfigProvider theme={{
    token: {
        colorPrimary: '#00b96b',
        fontSize: 18,
    },
    components: {
        Button: {
            defaultBg: '#D6BD98',
            defaultColor: '#1D1616',
            primaryColor: '#000B58',
            textTextColor: '#181C14',
        }
    }
}}>
    ...
    <Button type="primary">My Button with Custom Color</Button>
    ...
</ConfigProvider>
```

## Automatically start your ReactJS application with Netuno

Netuno allows you to start your ReactJS application together with the Netuno application server process.

> All the ReactJS application compilation messages will be integrated into the same terminal as the Netuno application.

To do this, simply add the following to the Netuno application's `commands` configuration in `ðŸ“‚ config/_development.json`:

```json title="config/_development.json"
{
    ...
    "commands": [
        ...
        {
            "path": "website",
            "command": "npm run dev",
            "install": "npm install",
            "enabled": true
        }
    ]
    ...
}
```

> Whenever you edit the Netuno application's configuration files, you will need to restart the application so that it can take on the new changes.

Finally, start/restart your Netuno application to check that it is working.

## CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) Configuration

To configure CORS to avoid possible errors between the ReactJS application and the Netuno application communicating through services, go to:

- `ðŸ“‚ config/_development.json`

Check if the `cors` configuration already exists or add this example:

```json title="config/_development.json"
{
    ...
    "cors": [
        {
            "enabled": true,
            "origins": [ "http://localhost:3000" ]
        }
    ],
    ...
}
```

> If `origins` contains a `*`, it means that any front-end address will be supported, for example:
> - `"origins": [ "*" ]`

With this configuration implemented, you can create the services you want without encountering CORS errors.

> More about [CORS](../server/services/cors.md)

### HTTP OPTIONS

The browser executes a call with the OPTIONS method of the HTTP protocol to the same address as the service, to validate whether or not it can actually execute the service.

Therefore, services need to respond to the OPTIONS method of the HTTP protocol to work without problems.

To do this, make sure that the services used on the website have the version of the code for `options`, which can be done as follows for an example service:

- ðŸ“‚ `server/services/example/options.js`
- ðŸ“‚ `server/services/example.options.js`

The content can be just:

```
_out.json(_val.map().set("result", true))
```

> More about [HTTP methods and Services](../server/services/rest.md).

## Environment Variables

You can define the environment variables by creating the `website/.env` file, with the variable definitions, for example:

```
NODE_ENV=development
```

Or by configuring the Netuno application, for example in:

- `ðŸ“‚ config/_development.json`

And defining the environment variables in the command configuration in the `env` parameterization, for example:

```json title="config/_development.json"
{
    ...
    "commands": [
        ...,
        {
            "env": ["NODE_ENV=development"],
            "path": "website",
            "command": "npm run start",
            "install": "npm install --force",
            "enabled": true
        }
    ]
}
```
