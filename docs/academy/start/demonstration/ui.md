## Introduction

The user interface _(UI)_ is the point of human-computer interaction and communication in a device. Will be performed inside the **ui** folder and is also the way through which a user interacts with an application or a website.

The _UI_ folder contains by default the development environment in <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank">ReactJS</a>, with <a href="https://ant.design/" target="_blank">Ant.Design</a> and <a href="http://lesscss.org/" target="_blank">Less</a>, while using <a href="https://webpack.js.org/" target="_blank">Webpack</a>.

These technologies are widely used today, however, this pre-defined environment will be not limited to these technologies themselves.

The user is free to use any other technology like **VueJS**, **MaterialUI**, **Sass**, **Bootstrap**, **TypeScript**, others. They can just change within the `üìÇ folder ui` the settings of `üìÇ package.json` and `üìÇ webpack.config.js` for the technologies they will choose.

> ### Integrated Terminal
>
> Always when _Netuno_ server starts it will also execute the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/" target="_blank">NPM</a> with the command `‚û°Ô∏è npm run watch` inside the `üìÇ ui` folder of the running application. In this case it will be the application **demo**_nstraction_.>
> The output of <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/" target="_blank">NPM</a> is integrated in the same output of the _Netuno_ server, so there is only one terminal with the integrated output of the server and the compilation of **U**_ser_ **I**_nterface_.

## Service Expend

As it was already created in the previous step the service **tasks** in `üìÇ server/services/tasks.js` through the Visual Studio Code, which provides the information in <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_intro.asp" target="_blank">JSON</a> in the address:

* <a href="http://localhost:9000/services/tarefas" target="_blank">http://localhost:9000/services/tarefas</a>

Now the next step is to run out of it to display the data on the browser's interface.

This data will be presented into a table and a graph.

Assuming you have Visual Studio Code or another editor open with the **Demo** app.

Open the file below in the editor:

`üìÇ ui/src/containers/DashboardContainer/index.jsx`

Next step will be to change this existing code.

### Preparing the `state`

Right at the very beginning of the `DashboardContainer` component class within the `constructor` is the definition of your _state_.

Add a new entry to save the task data, like this:

```jsx
        this.state = {
            workers: [], // Don't forget the comma.
            // üëá And add the new line of code below:
            tasks: []
        };
```

In other words, add the new `tasks : []` line and do not forget to add the "**,**" at the end of the previous line.

### Creating the Method `loadTasks`

Note that there is a method called `loadWorkers` this method performs the data retrieval of the workers that currently appears on the dashboard.

Under this method we will create a new method called `loadTasks` which will load the task data.

Insert the code below after the end of the `loadWorkers` method:

```jsx
    /**
    *** üöÄ Upload the Tasks data.
    ***    Through the execution of the service:
    **     http://localhost:9000/services/tasks
    */
    loadTasks() {
        netuno.service({
            url: '/services/tasks',
            success: (data)=> {
                this.setState({
                    tasks: data.json
                });
            },
            fail: (data)=> {
                console.log(data);
                message.error("Failed to load the list of total task records.")
            }
        });
    }
```

What this code does is to perform the service **tasks** and with the obtained data from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON" target="_blank">JSON</a> stores in the _state_ of the component <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank">ReactJS</a> in **tasks**, performing the execution of `this.setState` passing the tasks data.

In the final code the methods should be structured in this way, for example:

```jsx
    loadWorkers() {
        ...
    }

    loadTasks() {
        ...
    }

    render() {
        ...
    }
```

> Where the `...` are the various lines of code within their respective methods

### Run the new `loadTasks` method

Now we need to run our new `loadTasks` method when the component is "assembled", in the `componentDidMount' method, this method is run when the component is built in the visual presentation of the browser.

To do this just on the top add the line of code `this.loadTasks();` within the `componentDidMount` method, which will look like this:

```jsx
    // üîç Search the existing code for:
    componentDidMount() {
        this.loadWorkers();
        // üëá And add the new line of code below:
        this.loadTasks();
    }
```

The line that should be added is below:

```jsx
        this.loadTasks();
```

This will call the method that runs the service <a href="http://localhost:9000/services/tasks" target="_blank">http://localhost:9000/services/tasks</a> that was created to get the data in JSON and save it to the `state` (_status_) of the component to be presented in the render (_view_).

### Compilation

**Save** the file and then notice that at the **terminal** where you have Netuno running it will appear the result of the new compilation of the **ui**, adding lines from the compilation result of the <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank">ReactJS</a> + <a href="https://webpack.js.org/" target="_blank">WebPack</a>.

The expected outcome into **terminal** should be like this:

```
Hash: abe630735cdaa909166b
Version: webpack 4.41.2
Time: 969ms
Built at: 01/12/2019 21:42:28
     Asset      Size  Chunks                   Chunk Names
   main.js  3.11 MiB    main  [emitted]        main
main.js.map  3.47 MiB    main  [emitted] [dev]  main
Entrypoint main = main.js main.js.map
[./src/containers/DashboardContainer/index.jsx] 4.22 KiB {main} [built]
   + 425 hidden modules
```

If there is an error with the compilation then it will appear into the **terminal** with an indication issue.

So far we have performed your service spend **tasks** and the obtained data is stored into the `DashboardContainer` component that will be available for use in the `render`.

## Present the Data

To present the data on your browser should be change the `render` method, which processes the visual aspect of the components in <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank">ReactJS</a>.

At the end of the `DashboardContainer` code you will find the method: `render() { ... }`

For this step you just need to add one more line of code to contain one more `DataVisualization` component, but now to display the **tasks** data, the code should look like this:

```jsx
    // üîç Search the existing code for:
    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <DataVisualization data={this.state.trabalhadores} title={"Workers"} />
                // üëá And add the new line of code below:
                <DataVisualization data={this.state.tasks} title={"Tasks"} />
                <ListServices />
            </div>
        );
    }
```

Note that only the line below should be added:

```jsx
<DataVisualization data={this.state.tasks} title={"Tasks"} />
```

This way the `DataVisualization` will receive the obtained data through the service **tasks** via JSON and which are stored in the `state`.

### Final Compilation

**Save** the file with all the changes made so far.

Make sure there are no errors into the **terminal** output.

**Refresh** your browser and you should see the final result, or you can also click the link below:

* <a href="http://localhost:9000" target="_blank">http://localhost:9000</a>

> If the dashboard appears blank it means there are errors in the code.
>
> Check the **browser** console on the **programmer tools**.
