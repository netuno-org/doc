## Introduction

Industry 4.0 or (Fourth Industrial Revolution) is the current trend of automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies. It includes cyber-physical systems, the Internet of things (IoT) and cloud computing. Industry 4.0 creates what has been called a **“smart factory”**.

One of the main effects of the Fourth Industrial Revolution is increased human productivity. With technologies like AI and automation augmenting our professional lives, we're able to make smart choices, faster than ever before.

## Principles

As a result, researchers have identified six design principles that are crucial for businesses to embrace in order to realise the full benefits of industry 4.0 technology. These design principles are:

* **Interoperability**
* **real-time Capability**
* **Virtualization**
* **Decentralization**
* **Service Orientation**
* **Modularity**

## Relevant Technologies

Due to the technological advances of the last decade, allied to the technologies in development in the areas of information technology and engineering, Industry 4.0 is thus an increasingly possible reality.

These are some of the most relevant technologies:

* **Internet of Things**: It consists in the network connection of physical objects, environments, vehicles and machines through implemented electronic devices that allow the collection and exchange of data. The systems that are based on the Internet of Things, are called Cyber-physical and have sensors and actuators.
* **Big Data Analytics**: They are very extensive and complex data structures that use new approaches for the capture, analysis and management of information. Applied to Industry 4.0, Big Data technology consists of 6 C's to deal with relevant information:
  Connection to the industrial network, sensors and PLCs, Cloud Technology, Cyber ​​Security, Content, Community (Data sharing), Customization.
* **Security**: The security and strength of information systems is the major challenge for the success of Industry 4.0. Transmission failures in communication between machines or a simple atrophy of the system can cause production disruption.

## Nowadays Impact

Industry 4.0 undoubtedly affects the entire market, creating new business models.

Nowadays most companies seek to integrate the customer's individual needs and preferences into the product, avoiding the previous customization of the product by consumers, thus facilitating the manufacturing process.

Technology should have a continuous development, in order to make it possible for companies to adapt to this new industry standard.

Research and development demands will offer opportunities for technically qualified professionals, with multidisciplinary training to understand and work with the variety of technology that makes up an intelligent factory.

## i4.0 Program

Industry 4.0 Program is an initiative of the Portuguese Government that aims to accelerate the implementation of Industry 4.0 in Portugal.

[i4.o Industry](https://www.iapmei.pt/Paginas/Industria-4-0.aspx)

Main objectives:

##### 1. Accelerating the adoption of i4.0 by the Portuguese business

Supply the business sector with knowledge and information

Promote a set of tools for business transformation

Empower and readjust the national workforce

##### 2. Promote Portuguese technological suppliers as i4.0 players

Capitalize on the scientific and technological ecosystem

Create a best context for the development of i4.0 startups

Promote national technological solutions in an international context

##### 3. Making Portugal an attractive hub for investment in i4.0

Create best conditions (legal and tax) for investment directed to Industry 4.0

## _Netuno_ into Industry

_Netuno_ platform has been constantly evolving over its 18 years, the development of all layers of Backend service is optimized and strong, which saves time and programming, resulting in less hours / project, which it brings security in the fulfillment of the schedule and the certainty that the intended restructuring will obtain the highest levels of production performance.

_Netuno_ has conquers big companies and experienced developers every day.

* **Great Flow** - Using React + Redux, this feature makes navigation much more fluid and faster for the user.
* **Better use of resources** - FrontEnd server separate from the BackEnd server - Redux takes care of all the processing / processing of data that is rendered, implementing cache state control mechanisms. With this approach, the BackEnd server will have less load, allowing greater processing capacity.
* **High interoperability** - FrontEnd agnostic BackEnd - Considering a System on Chip (SoC) architecture, where BackEnd provides its functionality through RestAPI, the system is expandable so that in the future other applications can communicate with this BackEnd.
* **High Scalability** - Based on Netuno's it is possible to add data structures, without code changes.
* **Faster development and maintenance** - Netuno has implemented a low-code logic that enables fast development and maintenance of the basic services of the application.
* **Better web-base control** - Through the backoffice it is possible to directly access a simplified IDE, which supports features such as Coding and Queries.

## From the Base to Production

_Netuno_ is applicable to solve problems in all Business sectors, management data, and processes from the beginning till the final product.

![Netuno da Matéria Prima até a Produção.](/docs/assets/business/industry-netuno-1.jpg "Netuno da Matéria Prima até a Produção.")

> _Netuno_ supports production by ensuring that there is less waste and reducing failures.

## From Distribution until the Sale

_Netuno_ Assist in orchestrating the relationship with other critical stakeholders to ensure that the entire business flows as desired.

> _Netuno_ guarantees improvement in the entire process.

## Lean Six Sigma Methology

**DMAIC** refers to a data-driven improvement cycle used for improving, optimizing and stabilizing business processes and designs. The **DMAIC** improvement cycle is the core tool used to drive Six Sigma projects.

**D.M.A.I.C.** Methodology is a data-driven quality strategy used to improve processes as:

- **Define** the problem, improvement activity, opportunity for improvement, the project goals, and customer (internal and external) requirements.
1. Project charter to define the `focus`, `scope`, `direction`, and `motivation` for the improvement team;
2. `Voice of the customer` to understand feedback from current and future customers indicating offerings that satisfy, delight, and dissatisfy them;
3. Value stream map to `provide an overview of an entire process`, starting and finishing at the customer, and analyzing what is required to meet customer needs.
- **Measure** process performance.
1. Process map for recording the activities performed as part of a process. 
2. Capability analysis to assess the ability of a process to meet specifications;
3. Pareto chart to analyze the frequency of problems or causes.
- **Analyze** the process to determine root causes of variation and poor performance (defects).
1. Root cause analysis (RCA) to uncover causes;
2. Failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) for identifying `possible product`, `service`, and `process failures`;
3. Multi-vari chart to detect different types of variation within a process.
- **Improve** process performance by addressing and eliminating the root causes.
1. Design of experiments (DOE) to solve problems from complex processes or systems where there are many factors influencing the outcome and where it is impossible to isolate one factor or variable from the others;
2. `Kaizen event` to introduce rapid change by focusing on a narrow project and using the ideas and motivation of the people who do the work.
- **Control** the improved process and future process performance.
1. `Quality control plan` to document what is needed to keep an improved process at its current level
2. `Statistical process control` (SPC) for monitoring process behavior
3. 5S to create a `workplace suited for visual control`
Mistake proofing (poka-yoke) to make errors impossible or immediately detectable

> There is a perfect conection between _Netuno_ and _DMAIC_ methodology.

_Netuno_ supports automation to improve the 5 phases defined in the methodology:

- **D**_efine_: With all data gather is possible to centralize and analyze allowing a better definition of the improvements to be applied with great precision.
- **M**_easure_: Through the ability to create integrations to collect large amounts of data manually and automatically.
- **A**_nalyze_: Generate reports, dashboards and export data to other analysis tools.
- **I**_mprove_: Finding what can be improved depends on human decision which can be supported by automatic mechanisms on information.
- **C**_ontrol_: Information can be visible in Real-Time what gives us better management processes.
