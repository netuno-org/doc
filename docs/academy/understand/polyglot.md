_Netuno_ has polyglot service which allows you to run services simultaneously that are built in different languages, database and operating systems, without increase of processing weight.

With all these options there's no excuses to not be implemented into your Business.

All these advantages, makes easier the development as _Netuno_ can adapt himself in any situation and environment.

## DataBase

_Netuno_ also can integrated the most types of Database and be developed in different programming languages in the same project.

Integrating different databases is very common to perform data integration when doing queries or changing data in another database system's.

- PostgreSQL
- MariaDB
- Microsoft SQL Server
- Oracle

## Programming Languages

For the user cannot make sense to use multiple proragramming languages and mix it up, however can bring some benefits and advantages as this allows for easy modification by both the developers so they can test out new interface designs without messing with the highly complex physics and graphics engines underneath.

Projects end up using multiple languages for six main reasons:

- Cost benefits of reusing code written in other languages;
- The need to include and accommodate legacy code;
- Availability of coders for specific languages;
- The need for special languages for specialty needs;
- Legacy language biases;
- Poor project management (unplanned multi-language use).

With _Netuno_ none of the projects are wasted and if needed a new programming language because somehow the company strategy has changed or there is a lack of staff to develope technical projects or any other specific situation, any staff will be able to take the project and analyze and move foward with it as is a low-code solution, resources end up to be used in the same independent way and a very similar one to another.

_Netuno_ offers developement with the following programming languages:

- Groovy
- Java
- JavaScript
- Kotlin
- Python
- Ruby

## Operating Systems

_Netuno_ ensure the correct functioning of developments across the board and organize in environments of development, testing, quality, production as is supported by multilple Operating Systems.
