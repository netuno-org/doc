Learning new technologies is never easy for beginners, where there are increasingly many options and diversity.

In Netuno, you will find great simplification due to the aggregation of the best available and most used
solutions, thus reducing the risk of choosing the wrong solution and reducing the time to search for, find, and
test the ideal solution.

You will also find considerable flexibility by allowing the use of various programming languages integrated
with the main databases, with a wide variety of polyglot low-code programming resources that streamline the work.

> Do more with fewer lines of code.

Low-code programming for REST API web services allows for rapid development, enabling the creation of even the
most complex solutions to leverage integration with other systems, front-end applications, mobile applications,
portals, stores, etc.

The speed of development is also due to the fact that server restarts are never necessary; in polyglot
development, there are no compilations or restarts.

> Code changes are immediate and in real time.

Supported in all polyglot programming languages, such as:

- JavaScript
- Python
- Ruby
- Kotlin
- Groovy

Netuno simplifies the learning curve through its form creation interface, which intuitively generates the
database, allows you to view and experiment with the entire data model in the auto-generated back office, and
serves for refined data consistency testing. Because it has authentication and allows access profiles, it's
useful for the general management and maintenance of your database.

> Auto-generated back office with the database.

The moment you create the database, you have the back office ready, with relationships, refined search, image
and file upload, data export, and much more.

> The Netuno platform is open-source, [get started now](/docs/get-started/installation).

Those who start will find a fairly short learning curve; in a short time they will be able to perform complex
tasks.

They will intuitively master databases and web services with high productivity.

## Database

Database construction is simplified by the automatic generation of the back office, but also by the data diagram.

Netuno automatically generates the data model diagram and displays the fields that create the relationships.

To execute queries, Netuno offers an interface that allows you to save favorite commands, in addition to a log
of executed commands.

Multiple database commands can be executed simultaneously.

## Low-code and Polyglot

You can create multiple applications, where each application is a project, and in each application you can
develop with the various languages supported by Netuno.

The file extension defines which language engine will be used, for example:

- `.js` - JavaScript
- `.py` - Python
- `.rb` - Ruby
- `.kts` - Kotlin Script
- `.groovy` - Groovy

See the multilingual services in the demo application that comes standard with Netuno; notice that in the same
application, multiple languages are used simultaneously:

- [apps/demo/server/services/samples](https://github.com/netuno-org/platform/tree/main/bundle/base/apps/demo/server/services/samples)

Use your preferred programming language; for obvious reasons, we do not recommend using multiple programming
languages in the same project.

The example below demonstrates how to use various polyglot programming features in JavaScript:
