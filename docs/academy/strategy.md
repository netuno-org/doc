In this section the user will find explanations and examples on how _Netuno_ can be applied into the projects.

Considering that _Netuno_ allows the developement in any type of `web-based project` such as **REST API**, **Backoffice**, **Data Integration**, **Websites**, **Portals**, **Intranet**, integration with mobile applications and others.

Over time _Netuno_ has been developed as a result of aggregate strong and reliable technologies, building a consistent environment from the programmer to the end-user. Consequently, these aggregations tend to bring great benefits in many technical challenges by implementing web-based solutions.

Is important to highlight that reducing implementation time will allow you to focus on what really matters, for example, implementation issues having as a consequence in the final result quality increased.

Benefits as this come from Excellence and High Standard Platforms.

_Netuno_ advantages are to ensure that:

- Projects have lower costs, as will reduce development time; 
- Higher Quality, as our programmers will have more time to focus to solve important issues;
- Greater confidence in the solution by stakeholders; consequently it will also increase the demand for short-term projects.

As you discover this advantages you will notice using _Netuno_ with the most challenging projects.

It is up to you to use Netuno to solve your challenges, knowing that we are here to help you in whatever is necessary through our social networks and forum.

Enjoy this powerful Web Development Tool that will make your life easier in many ways during the project development process.


Netuno is a server with a framework that has a backoffice both to assist the development and to perform the administration and manipulation of data online, all this available multi-applicationally. Additionally, it provides support for multiple databases and multiple programming languages.

For these and other reasons it is characterized as a platform, especially for the implementation of web-based projects with the best and latest technologies.

The scenarios where Netuno can be used are many, but slowly using Netuno in projects here and there will begin to discover how much Netuno helps solve problems and complexity.

Netuno is being used in various fields, such as:

- In industry with the collection of manufacturing information.
- In accounting with the management of processes and tasks.
- In the control of servers and virtual machines.
- In the control of hosting and mails services.
- In the management and sharing of passwords.
- In integration with SAP.
- In integration with BPM.

- And much more...

> The Netuno platform is free, [start now](../installation/).

With the automatic data management interface that supports user and group profiles, it is possible to use Netuno as a backoffice but also as an application interface for the end user, because it quickly allows you to create an experimental prototype of the project and start testing and filing your data structure to provide a strong foundation for the programming that will be carried out.

With the low-code REST API construction and OpenAPI 3.0 support it allows easy integration with other systems, mobile applications, portals and online stores.

With the generation of applications with the frontend already integrated with ReactJS and Ant.Design it is possible to develop modern, intuitive and responsive interfaces for the end user.

It integrates the NPM + WebPack execution with the server and thus, in a single output, allows to understand what happens and quickly visualize the problems both at backend and frontend areas.

The Netuno framework is vast allowing the rapid development of the main requirements most used in development and supports integration with any external library in Java, Kotlin, command line, APIs, among others.

It supports configurations by environments of development, testing and production, automatically generates the construction of the database via code and allows it to be customized, allows the extension of the forms generated automatically through components and actions to measure, generates the visualization in diagram of the database, allows the execution of queries in the database via browser, among many other features.

The Netuno server is prepared to provide applications associated with web domains and customize the endpoints (addresses).

Conquer new challenges through the advantages that Netuno offers, gain time and save money in project development.
