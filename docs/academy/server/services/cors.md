CORS configuration in the application.

## Introduction

CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing) is a validation process that browsers perform to verify whether they can 
integrate resources shared by another address.

It is implemented when:

- In frontend development with the webpack server, such as developing web interfaces (website or web 
  application) using modern technologies like ReactJS and VueJS.
- The frontend address is different from the service address, for example, when services run at
  `http://localhost:9000` and the frontend runs at `http://localhost:3000`.
- In production, for example, services run on their own subdomain `api.example.com` and the frontend runs at
  `www.example.com`.

Netuno is prepared to perform CORS integration in a simple and immediate way.

## Configuration

CORS configuration is performed in the application's configuration file, depending on the environment.

To do this, navigate within the application you are developing to the environment configuration file.
In this example, we will use the development environment file located at:

- ðŸ“‚ `config/_development.json`

Check that there are no existing CORS configurations. If not, add the following configuration parameters to the 
end of the configuration file (in JSON format):

```json title="config/_development.json"
{
    ...
    "cors": [
        {
            "enabled": true,
            "origins": [ "http://localhost:3000", "http://127.0.0.1:3000" ]
        }
    ]
    ...
}
```

> The CORS configuration is an array and supports several distinct CORS rules.

### Origins

The `origins` parameter contains the list of addresses for the frontend that will be integrated with the services.

### Production

In production, we must define the addresses where the frontend will run online as sources.

The application configuration file where the `cors` definition is located should be different depending on the environment.

The application configuration file should be:

- ðŸ“‚ `config/_production.json`

Example of CORS configuration:

```json title="config/_production.json"
{
    ...
    "cors": [
        {
            "enabled": true,
            "origins": [ "https://meu-projeto.com", "https://www.meu-projeto.com" ]
        }
    ]
    ...
}
```

The application configuration file is `_production.json` according to the Netuno environment configuration, which
is located in the `netuno/config.js` file:

```javascript title="netuno/config.js"
config.env = 'production'
```

## HTTP Header

The standard HTTP protocol header is:

```http
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://localhost:3000
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET,PUT,POST,DELETE,OPTIONS
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: DNT,User-Agent,X-Requested-With,If-Modified-Since,Cache-Control,Content-Type,Range,Authorization
Access-Control-Allow-Expose-Headers: Content-Length,Content-Range
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
```

To customize the default header, add the `header` configuration parameter, for example:

```json title="config/_development.json"
{
    ...
    "cors": [
        {
            "enabled": true,
            "header": {
                "Access-Control-Allow-Headers": "Authorization"
            },
            "origins": [ "http://localhost:3000", "http://127.0.0.1:3000" ]
        }
    ]
    ...
}
```

In the example above, it will only accept the `Authorization` header instead of all the others that were defined
by default.

You can add new definitions to the header, such as overriding the default definition.

## Manually

You can also manually configure CORS, instead of using Netuno's automatic mechanism.

In your Netuno application, simply modify the file:

- ðŸ“‚ `server/core/_request_url.js`

And use the following code:

```javascript title="server/core/_request_url.js"
const httpHeaderOrigin = _header.getString("Origin", "null")

if (httpHeaderOrigin == 'https://www.my-app.com'
	|| httpHeaderOrigin == 'http://localhost'
	|| httpHeaderOrigin == 'http://localhost:3000') {
	_header.response.set("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", httpHeaderOrigin)
	_header.response.set("Access-Control-Allow-Methods", "GET,PUT,POST,DELETE,OPTIONS")
	_header.response.set("Access-Control-Allow-Headers", "content-type,x-requested-with,authorization")
	_header.response.set("Access-Control-Allow-Credentials", true)
}
```

Note that in the code above, the `if` restricts the headers based on the origin address.

Remember to adjust this to the addresses you'll be using.

> This way, all services and addresses in your application will support CORS headers.

### Only for Isolated Services

If you want to increase the level of security by enabling headers only for specific services, then use
this same code logic in the file:

- ðŸ“‚ `server/core/_service_config.js`

Instead of the file:

- ðŸ“‚ `server/core/_request_url.js`

## Conclusion

When CORS is configured, Netuno will automatically respond with the default header (HTTP protocol header)
for addresses configured as `origins`.

The default `headers` can be customized and changed.

You can configure multiple CORS rules.

Although Netuno supports manual configuration of CORS rules programmatically, it is preferable to use the 
automatic mechanism integrated into the application configuration.
