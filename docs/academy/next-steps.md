Keep in mind what it takes to continue your evolution on Netuno.

The documentation as a whole is constantly being improved and tries to be as simple and introductory as possible.

But it is assumed that it has some knowledge base and some experience, such as:

* Database: such as queries in general, insert, update and delete;
* Web services: with GET and POST;
* <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/JavaScript" target="_blank">JavaScript</a> and <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank">ReactJS</a>;

If you don't have any of these skills, we'll try to help you develop them.

Always look for help in the GitHub or Discord, look the indications in the footer of this site.

## Database

With Netuno you will be able to work with various types of databases and deepen your knowledge.

Only with a good knowledge of database is it possible to create applications with complex structures to collect and manage large volumes of data.

This way you will have the autonomy to create in a robust way the most important part that is the database.

The construction of a well organized and optimized database makes all the difference in the experience of the end users as well as the performance from development to execution.

## Services

If you already have some knowledge in any of the following programming languages like <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/JavaScript" target="_blank">JavaScript</a>, <a href="http://groovy-lang.org/" target="_blank">Groovy</a>, <a href="https://www.jython.org/" target="_blank">Python</a>, <a href="https://www.jruby.org/" target="_blank">Ruby</a> or <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/" target="_blank">Kotlin</a>, you can quickly create complex and robust web services using the various features that Netuno provides for **low code** programming.

Inside the applications folder especially in the **server** folder, you can program in these various languages.

Just use the corresponding extension:

* **.js** &nbsp; <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript" target="_blank">JavaScript</a>
* **.groovy** &nbsp; <a href="http://groovy-lang.org/" target="_blank">Groovy</a>
* **.py** &nbsp; <a href="https://www.jython.org/" target="_blank">Python</a>
* **.rb** &nbsp; <a href="https://www.jruby.org/" target="_blank">Ruby</a>
* **.kts** &nbsp; <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/" target="_blank">Kotlin</a>

Explore the examples of web services that come in the application **demo**_nstration_, at:

- `/apps/demo/server/services/samples`

And also explore the documentation of our **library** to know in detail the resources available.


## User Interface

The development of the frontend on the web has undergone many changes in recent years and the use of <a href="https://webpack.js.org" target="_blank">Webpack</a> has become a standard.

Our choices of technologies such as <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank">ReactJS</a>, <a href="https://ant.design/" target="_blank">Ant.Design</a> and <a href="http://lesscss.org/" target="_blank">Less</a>, are the technologies that bring an increase in productivity with the highest uptake in the community.

To deepen your knowledge of these technologies explore the various documentations available in text and video format over the Internet.

Since they are technologies with large communities it is not difficult to find good material to start learning.

Remembering that with Netuno even with a little knowledge is already possible to get great results, and gives power by developing the frontend to also develop the entire backend and vice versa, you can still choose to develop everything with just a single programming language such as <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript" target="_blank">JavaScript</a>.

## Conclusion

Netuno facilitates the development of web applications where only a single person with little knowledge of database, web services and frontend, can develop complex applications autonomously.

Also for large teams where there are people with greater competence in each of the areas, there is a great increase in productivity.

Netuno can also be used as a backoffice for databases or as a REST API server for decoupled frontend and mobile applications.

Save time and develop more focused on the logic of business rules and with the knowledge you already have you will go further.
